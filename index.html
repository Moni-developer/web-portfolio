        <p>Web development does not just contain the designing part, but it also enables a new trend in the market.Here are some reasons I found as to why Web Development is much required in todayâ€™s developing world.
            1) The web applications are more reliable than apps
            2) Browsers are getting more power day by day
            3) JavaScript developers are the highest paid developers in the world.</p>
